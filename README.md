# Banking Database Management System  
**Tech Stack:** SQL · ER Modeling · Oracle/SQL Server (course-level)

---

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Database Management Systems** course in the 2nd year of my Computer Engineering studies.  
It simulates a banking database to store and manage essential entities such as:

- Bank branches, customers, and employees  
- Accounts and balances (savings, current, foreign currency, investment, etc.)  
- Loans and credit limits  

The project demonstrates **ER modeling, normalization, and SQL queries** for common banking operations.

## Key Features
- ER Diagram and normalized database schema  
- Example SQL queries:
  - Customer and account listings  
  - Branch-wise employee salary totals  
  - Top 5 customers by balance  
  - Customers with specific account or loan types  
  - Total credit given per bank  
- Database scripts and sample data
